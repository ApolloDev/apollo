=Definition=
Any parameters that aren't specified as part of Apollo-SV, and as a result aren't defined in the common Apollo classes.

=Why do we need unregistered parameters?=
It is possible that Apollo-SV won't define required parameters for every epidemic model that is using Apollo.  While parameters defined in Apollo-SV ([RegisteredParameters] registered parameters) are defined in the common Apollo classes, there needs to be a mechanism in place to pass other parameters as well.
