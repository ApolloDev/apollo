#summary Introduction to working on Apollo-WS as a software developer

=System Requirements=

A design goal of Apollo-WS is to remain 100% programming-language agnostic.  Therefore development should be possible in any language that supports SOAP web services, and optimally, can generate classes given an XML schema.

==Lead Developer== 
The project's lead developer developed the components of Apollo-WS primarily in Java using the Eclipse IDE with the WTP plug-in.  It is likely that examples and documentation will be in Java format.
