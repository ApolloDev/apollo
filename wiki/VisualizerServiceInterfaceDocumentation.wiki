== Methods ==

=== runVisualization ===
==== Description ==== 
This method creates a visualization of epidemic model output.

==== Input ====

  # visualizerConfiguration (of type VisualizerConfiguration) - An object that contains the configuration parameters of a visualizer.

==== Output ====
  #  runId (of type Token) -  A string identifier that uniquely identifies a run on all Apollo services.  A runId is created by concatenating the _visualizerDeveloper_, _visualizerName_, and _visualizerVersion_ fields from the VisualizerIdentification section of the VisualizerConfiguration object, and then appending a unique integer to the string.  All fields should be separated by an underscore.  For example, the runId for the 37th run of the GAIA simulator built by the University of Pittsburgh may look like this: *PSC_GAIA_v2.0_27*.
  #  visualizationResultURL (of standard XML type anyURI) - a URL, which specifies the location at which the visualization will be available for download once it has been created

=== getRunStatus ===
==== Description ====
This method is used to query the status of a run of an ApolloService.
==== Input ====

  #  runStatus (of type RunStatus) - An object containing a free text status description, and an enumerated type containing on the following members:
        * queued
        * running
