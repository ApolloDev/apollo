= Introduction =

ApolloWsClient is a simple Apollo Web Service front-end written in PHP.

= How to install =

 * Download and install [http://www.apache.org/ Apache]
  * If you have little experience in server configuration, I recommend you can download and install [http://www.zend.com/en/products/server-ce/ Zend Server Community Edition]
  * Please make sure you are dwonloading the [http://www.zend.com/en/download/355 Newest version shipped with PHP 5.3].
  * After you successfully installed the Zend Server CE, open the location that you've specified during the installation, locate the 'Apache2' subfolder.

 * Checkout the source code of ApolloWsClient using SVN.
  * Place the code into the 'webroot' of your apache server, usually its the 'htdoc' folder under the 'Apache2' subfolder.
  * e.g. Check out the code using SVN like below:
{{{
svn checkout https://apollo.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/apollo-ws/web-client C:/ZendServerCE/Apache2/htdoc/WsClient
}}}
  * Now the folder structure should be something like this:
{{{
C:/ZendServerCE/Apache2/htdoc/WsClient
}}}
 * Open the browser, type in the address you've specified in apache and try to access the client.
  * From the example above, it should be:
{{{
http://localhost/WsClient
}}}
  * If your server's port number is 8080 other than 80, you need to change the address above to
{{{
http://localhost:8080/WsClient
}}}

= Hints =

 * Config the Apollo Web Service WSDL location
  * Please make sure the WSDL location is correct.
