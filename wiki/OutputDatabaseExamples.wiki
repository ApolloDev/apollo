#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Introduction =

On this page, we'll go over a couple of examples for how an output database could look under certain situations.

In all but the first case, the run table and the time_series table have been omitted.  The time_series table simply represents the counts of organisms which exist in a given population.  The run table merely describes the simulation software and identifies specific runs.


= Influenza SIER for two census blocks =

In this example, we'll create a sample output from a SIER model which models influenza for two census blocks.  This model does not discriminate sex or age, only SIER states and location.

So, we have 8 different simulated populations: 1 for each epidemic state (susceptible, infected, exposed, and recovered) in each census block (CB1, CB2).

|| *Population* || *Epidemic State* || *Census Block* ||
|| 1 || susceptible || CB1 ||
|| 2 || infected || CB1 ||
|| 3 || exposed || CB1 ||
|| 4 || recovered || CB1 ||
|| 5 || susceptible || CB2 ||
|| 6 || infected || CB2 ||
|| 7 || exposed || CB2 ||
|| 8 || recovered || CB2 ||

The tables for this set of populations would look like what's shown below.

= Influenza SIER for two census blocks and two age ranges =

In this example, we'll create a sample output from a SIER model which models influenza for two census blocks with two different age ranges.  

So, we have 16 different simulated populations: 1 for each epidemic state (susceptible, infected, exposed, and recovered) in each census block (CB1, CB2) in each age range (0 - 9, 10 - 19).

|| *Population* || *Epidemic State* || *Census Block* || *Age Range* ||
|| 1 || susceptible || CB1 || 0 - 9 || 
|| 2 || infected || CB1 || 0 - 9 ||
|| 3 || exposed || CB1 || 0 - 9 ||
|| 4 || recovered || CB1 || 0 - 9 ||
|| 5 || susceptible || CB2 || 0 - 9 ||
|| 6 || infected || CB2 || 0 - 9 ||
|| 7 || exposed || CB2 || 0 - 9 ||
|| 8 || recovered || CB2 || 0 - 9 ||
|| 9 || susceptible || CB1 || 10 - 19 || 
|| 10 || infected || CB1 || 10 - 19 ||
|| 11 || exposed || CB1 || 10 - 19 ||
|| 12 || recovered || CB1 || 10 - 19 ||
|| 13 || susceptible || CB2 || 10 - 19 ||
|| 14 || infected || CB2 || 10 - 19 ||
|| 15 || exposed || CB2 || 10 - 19 ||
|| 16 || recovered || CB2 || 10 - 19 ||

The tables for this set of populations would look like what's shown below.

= Influenza SIER for two census blocks with a discriminator between newly exposed and not newly exposed=

In this example, we'll create a sample output from a SIER model which models influenza for two census blocks, keeping track of the number of newly exposed.  This model does not discriminate sex or age, only SIER states and location.

So, we have 9 different simulated populations: 1 for each epidemic state (susceptible, infected, newly exposed, not newly exposed, and recovered) in each census block (CB1, CB2).

|| *Population* || *Epidemic State* || *Census Block* ||
|| 1 || susceptible || CB1 ||
|| 2 || infected || CB1 ||
|| 3 || newly exposed || CB1 ||
|| 4 || not newly exposed || CB1 ||
|| 5 || recovered || CB1 ||
|| 6 || susceptible || CB2 ||
|| 7 || infected || CB2 ||
|| 8 || exposed || CB2 ||
|| 9 || recovered || CB2 ||

The tables for this set of populations would look like what's shown below.
