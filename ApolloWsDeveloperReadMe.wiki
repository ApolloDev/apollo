#summary Introduction to working on Apollo-WS as a software developer

=Getting Started=

==Java==
The URL [https://apollo.googlecode.com/svn/apollo-ws/service-skeletons/java/trunk/ https://apollo.googlecode.com/svn/apollo-ws/service-skeletons/java/trunk/] provides skeletons for the ApolloService, SimulatorService, and VisualizerService.

To compile the services:
  # download Maven 3 ([http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi])
  # edit your system path so that the "mvn" executable can be run from the command line
  # from the project root directory, type "mvn clean install"

The services will be built, and WARs will be produced in their respective "war/target" directories.  These wars can be deployed to Tomcat.  

==Python==

We currently provide Python service skeletons for the SimulatorService and the VisualizerService.  These skeletons require The Zolera Soap Infrastructure, v2.0_rc3.

The SimulatorService can be downloaded here: [https://apollo.googlecode.com/svn/apollo-ws/service-skeletons/python/simulator-service/trunk/ https://apollo.googlecode.com/svn/apollo-ws/service-skeletons/python/simulator-service/trunk/], and the VisualizerService can be downloaded here: [https://apollo.googlecode.com/svn/apollo-ws/service-skeletons/python/visualizer-service/trunk/ https://apollo.googlecode.com/svn/apollo-ws/service-skeletons/python/visualizer-service/trunk/]. 

To run the simulator service, run "SimulatorService.py."  To test the service, run "SimulatorServiceClient.py." 

To run the visualizer service, run "VisualizerService.py." To test the service, run "VisualizerServiceClient.py."
