	<p>This page is a very basic example of a screen that an application developer might include in an application used by epidemiologists or other personnel working in public health (e.g., an epidemiologist's workstation).</p><p>This page demonstrates the functionally that Apollo enables, which is programmatic access to external epidemic models. In this example, the user selects the name of the external epidemic model and the location and start date of the epidemic. This small example then requests the external epidemic model to run a job with the specified parameters, waits for the run to complete, obtains the results, and displays them.</p></div>
