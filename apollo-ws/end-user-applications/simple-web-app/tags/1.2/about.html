	<p>This page is a very basic example of a screen that an application developer might include in an application used by epidemiologists or other personnel working in public health (e.g., an epidemiologist's workstation).</p><p>This page demonstrates the functionally that Apollo enables, which is programmatic access to external epidemic models. 
            In this example, the user selects the name of the external epidemic model from a list of those that have been registered with the Apollo web service and sets the parameters of the model. This example application then requests the external epidemic model to run a job with the specified parameters, waits for the run to complete,
            then requests that a number of visualizers registered with the Apollo web service run to create visual representations of the results.</p></div>
