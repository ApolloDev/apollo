\chapter{CGI Script Struct}

\section{Intro} This is an example of a simple web service CGI Script.  The service
returns and expects SOAP Structs (python \class{dict}).  A sample soap trace is
provided below.  In this example the CGI script is dispatched as a \emph{rpc}
service.

\subsection{rpc wrapper} The wrapper element of the request is the dispatch key
to the callback function, the child elements are passes as a \class{list} or
\class{dict} of values to the callback function.  The callback function is
expected to return a \class{list} or \class{dict} of values, the response
wrapper is by default set to the request wrapper name appended \emph{Response}.
