\begin{abstract}
\noindent
\ZSI{}, the Zolera SOAP Infrastructure, is a Python package that
provides an implementation of SOAP messaging, as described in
\citetitle[http://www.w3.org/TR/soap]{The SOAP 1.1 Specification}.
In particular, \ZSI{} parses and generates SOAP messages, and
converts between native Python datatypes and SOAP syntax.
It can also be used to build applications using
\citetitle[http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP-attachments]{SOAP Messages with
Attachments}.
\ZSI{} is ``transport neutral'', and provides only a simple
I/O and dispatch framework; a more complete solution is the
responsibility of the application using \ZSI{}.
As usage patterns emerge, and common application frameworks are
more understood, this may change.

\ZSI{} requires Python 2.3 or later and PyXML version 0.8.3 or later.

The \ZSI{} homepage is at \url{http://pywebsvcs.sf.net/}.
