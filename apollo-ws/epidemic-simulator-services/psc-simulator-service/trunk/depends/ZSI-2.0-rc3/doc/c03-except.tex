\chapter{Exceptions}

\begin{excdesc}{ZSIException}
Base class for all ZSI Exceptions, it is a subtype of the Python
\exception{Exception} class.
\end{excdesc}

\begin{excdesc}{ParseException}
\ZSI{} can raise this exception while creating a \class{ParsedSoap} object.
It is a subtype of the \exception{ZSIException} class.
The string form of a \exception{ParseException} object consists of a
line of human-readable text.
If the backtrace is available, it will be concatenated as a second line.
\end{excdesc}

The following attributes are read-only:

\begin{memberdesc}{inheader}
A boolean that indicates if the error was detected in the SOAP \code{Header}
element.
\end{memberdesc}

\begin{memberdesc}{str}
A text string describing the error.
\end{memberdesc}

\begin{memberdesc}{trace}
A text string containing a backtrace to the error.
This may be \code{None} if it was not possible, such as when there was
a general DOM exception, or when the \code{str} text is believed to be
sufficient.
\end{memberdesc}

\begin{excdesc}{EvaluateException}
This exception is similar to \exception{ParseException}, except
that \ZSI{} may raise it while converting between SOAP and local
Python objects.
\end{excdesc}

The following attributes are read-only:

\begin{memberdesc}{str}
A text string describing the error.
\end{memberdesc}

\begin{memberdesc}{trace}
A text backtrace, as described above for \exception{ParseException}.
\end{memberdesc}
