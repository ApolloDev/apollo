This directory includes a server that implements "Round 2" interoperability
testing.  More information is available from:
    The soapbuilders mailing list, a forum for people creating SOAP
    implementations.  See http://yahoogroups.com/group/soapbuilders

    An "invitation to join the testing" message can be found at
    http://groups.yahoo.com/group/soapbuilders/message/5885

The client.py program will send pre-formatted test packets to a server.
I have not done generic client test, for a couple of reasons:
    1.  Too hard to keep track of all the endpoints; and
    2.  I'm not good at writing corner-case tests that stretch the limits
    3.  The server already exercises all the code -- it parses and
	serializes There are several other clients out there already

There are some other tests not currently implemented (in probable order
of increasing difficulty):

a.  Polymorph service (get a struct, return the parts, etc.).  See WSDL at
    http://www.whitemesa.net/wsdl/polymorph.wsdl

b.  Document/literal encoding.  See WSDL at
    http://www.whitemesa.net/wsdl/interopdoc.wsdl

c.  WS-Routing (not yet implemented in ZSI :).  See WSDL at
    http://www.whitemesa.net/wsdl/interop_base_end.wsdl
