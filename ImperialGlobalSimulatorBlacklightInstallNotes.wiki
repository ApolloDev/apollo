*Downloading*
The software is available for download at http://sourceforge.net/projects/globalepidemics/

All of the script files had DOS "^M" in them, so I had to run everything through "fromdos" to put them appropriately in linux format.

*Compiling*
The linux binaries that were provided for the C++ code were not appropriate for Blacklight, as was the MPI version that was used to compile them. So I had to recompile.

1. Go to directory src/
2. I found a bug in the source file "SynthpPopul/Util.cpp" in the function DataIn::ReadDataBlock(unsigned int id).  The variable id_ was declared as a char, and it needs to be defined as an int on line 500.
3. Sim requires libodbc, so I had to download and install unixODBC, which is available at http://www.unixodbc.org/.
