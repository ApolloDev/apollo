= Introduction =

This page will tell you how to install ApolloWsClient on your local server step by step.

= Install the Apache Web Server =
Expert Users:
  * Download and install the [http://www.apache.org/ Apache] web server
Novice Users (Windows Users Only):
  * Download and install version 5.3 of the Zend Server Community Distribution of Apache, from the following location: [http://www.zend.com/en/download/355 http://www.zend.com/en/download/355]
    * The remainder of this document will assume that you installed the Zend Server Community Distribution of Apache in the following directory: C:\ZendServerCE
= Download the source code = 
  # After you successfully installed Apache, open the installation directory and locate the 'Apache2/htdoc' sub folder.  This is the folder in which the Apollo-WS Client will reside. 
  # Checkout the source code of ApolloWsClient using SVN.
  # Place the code into the 'webroot' of your apache server, usually its the 'htdoc' folder under the 'Apache2' subfolder.
    * e.g. If you installed using the Zend Server Community Distribution of Apache, check out the code using SVN like below:
{{{
svn checkout https://apollo.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/apollo-ws/end-user-applications/simple-web-app/trunk C:/ZendServerCE/Apache2/htdoc/apollo-web-client
}}}
  * Now the folder structure should look like this:
{{{
C:/ZendServerCE/Apache2/htdoc/apollo-web-client
}}}
 * Open the browser, type in the address you've specified in apache and try to access the client.
  * From the example above, it should be:
{{{
http://localhost/apollo-web-client
}}}
  * If your server's port number is 8080 other than 80, you need to change the address above to
{{{
http://localhost:8080/apollo-web-client
}}}
